# Canva Education - UK Teacher Document Generator

Generate UK Teacher documents for Canva Education verification.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Canva uses Goodstack** (not SheerID) for teacher verification
- **Requires 2 documents**: Teaching ID + Teaching licence
- Documents must show: **Full name + School name + Teaching position**
- Upload manually at [canva.com/education](https://canva.com/education)

## Verification Workflow

Based on [Issue #49](https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/SheerID-Verification-Tool/issues/49) and [Issue #55](https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/SheerID-Verification-Tool/issues/55):
